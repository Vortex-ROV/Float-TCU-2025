## Introduction

The **Vertical Profiling Float** is designed to collect essential data from various sensors as it traverses different depths in the water column. The TCU is the topside interface that processes sensor readings, provides real-time graphing for quick analysis, and communicates with other control systems. It enables competition teams and research groups to monitor underwater environments accurately and efficiently.


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/VerticalProfilingFloat-TCU.git
   cd VerticalProfilingFloat-TCU
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate one:

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
3. **Install Packaged Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
4. **Run the TCU Software:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
